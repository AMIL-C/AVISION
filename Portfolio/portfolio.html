					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
					<p>I feel it's necessary to know how to code, because it makes me feel more connected with the site I'm building, which means that I will be more passionate about the given project.</p>

					<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
					<p>I would never skimp on the CSS. That would be like making a good old-fashioned cheeseburger without all the trimmings: no lettuce, tomatoe, ketchup, or onions? It just isn't done, and a website with no CSS would be just as dull and tacky.</p>

					<h3>Ease Converting Designs Into Code</h3>
					<p>I'll work hard to code and/or modify the psd for your website in as little time as possible, and I will do it with a huge smile on my face.</p>
