			    <div class="half-width">
			    	<p>My unlimited imagination has always driven me to want to epress myself through my main passion, which is fiction writing, but my ambitions do not end there. I also, eventually, developed a strong interest in tech, app, and web development.

				<div class="half-width">
				    <p>This dream of becoming such a part of the tech and development world drove me to begin taking computer hardware courses for starters. Eventually, however, I also started taking online courses for web development through various online teaching sites like TeamTreehouse, Codecademy, Khan Academy, and currently, Skillcrush. Now, granted, I haven't made my mark in the tech, web, or app development world just yet, but I definitely have the right skills for the job, at least as a web developer.</p>
